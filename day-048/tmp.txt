In CPython, the global interpreter lock, or GIL, is a mutex that prevents multiple native threads from executing
Python bytecodes at once. This lock is necessary mainly because CPython’s memory management is not thread-safe.
(However, since the GIL exists, other features have grown to depend on the guarantees that it enforces.)
